            <p>
                Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest individual, is known for his
                eccentric personality and active presence on Twitter. He frequently
                uses the platform to share updates about his companies, Tesla and
                SpaceX, his support for cryptocurrency, and his opinions about
                Twitter. In this website, I will examine Musk's Twitter style and
                investigate potential links between his tweets, relevant stock prices,

    <h2>Tweet Style</h2>
    <p>
        This section will examine Elon Musk's tweeting style, covering his top
        five most-liked tweets, tweet frequency and interactions, tweet sentiment,
        and frequently used words.

    <h3>Top Five Most-Liked Tweets</h3>
    <p>
        Using a Python algorithm, I found Musk's top five most-liked tweets as of
        March 5, 2022:

    <h3>Tweet Frequency</h3>
    <p>
        Next, I generated graphs to depict Elon Musk's tweet frequency:
    </p>
    <div class="plotly-container">
        <iframe class="plotly-visualizations" scrolling="no" src="plotly/viz_tweet_freq.html" height="550"
            width="2160"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        The visualizations display Elon Musk's tweet frequency categorized by
        month (1-12) and day (1-31). Upon examining the Tweet Frequency vs. Month
        plot, we observe that Musk is most active on Twitter during July and May,
        respectively, while his tweet frequency tends to be higher in the first
        half of the year compared to the second half, with September seeing the
        least amount of tweets. In terms of individual dates, the Tweet Frequency
        vs. Day plot indicates that the 25th of each month is his most frequently
        used day to tweet. The plot displays a relatively uniform distribution,
        indicating that Musk maintains a consistent tweeting pattern throughout
        each month.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Tweet Interactions</h3>
    <p>Then, I generated graphs to depict Elon Musk's Twitter Twitter interactions:</p>
    <div class="plotly-container">
        <iframe class="plotly-visualizations" scrolling="no" src="plotly/viz_likes_retweets_replies.html" height="550"
            width="2160"></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class="margin"></div>
    <div class="plotly-container">
        <iframe class="plotly-visualizations" scrolling="no" src="plotly/viz_likes_retweets_replies_cont.html"
            height="550" width="2160"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        The following visualizations depict Elon Musk's Twitter activity in terms
        of likes, retweets, and replies from 2010 to March 2022. The upper plots
        display the distribution by year, while the lower plots break down the
        distribution by day. Interestingly, the likes, retweets, and replies
        exhibit similar trends in both the upper and lower sets. The plots reveal
        that Elon Musk's popularity on Twitter skyrocketed, particularly from 2016
        onward. Moreover, his Twitter interactions are on track to surpass
        previous years' records and reach new heights in 2022.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Tweet Sentiment</h3>
    <p>
        I utilized two popular sentiment analysis tools, VADER and TextBlob,
        to investigate the sentiment of Elon Musk's tweets;
    </p>
    <div class="plotly-container">
        <iframe class="plotly-visualizations" scrolling="no" src="plotly/viz_subj_pol.html" height="550"
            width="2160"></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class="plotly-container">
        <iframe class="plotly-visualizations" scrolling="no" src="plotly/viz_vader.html" height="550"
            width="2160"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>
        The two graphs employ different sentiment analysis techniques to evaluate
        the emotional tone of Elon Musk's tweets. The upper graph, Tweet
        Subjectivity vs. Polarity, utilizes the TextBlob sentiment analyzer to
        produce two scores per tweet: subjectivity, which gauges the level of
        objectivity or opinion in the tweet, and polarity, which measures the
        degree of emotional positivity or negativity. Hovering over a point on the
        plot allows you to view the corresponding tweet. On the other hand, the
        Tweet Frequency vs. VADER Polarity graph employs the VADER (Valence Aware
        Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) analysis to display the frequency of
        positive or negative sentiments with scores ranging from -1 to 1. VADER is
        optimized for social media data.
        <br /><br />
        Both graphs demonstrate that Elon Musk predominantly tweets with positive
        sentiments. The upper plot displays an approximately inverted bell curve,
        with the majority of his tweets centered around zero subjectivity and zero
        polarity. The data on the lower plot is skewed to the left, with the
        highest concentration of tweets receiving a VADER score between +0.4 and
        +0.45. An independent Python calculation reveals that using TextBlob, the
        ratio of positive to negative tweets is 3.59, while with VADER, it is
        3.30. These findings further emphasize that Musk's Twitter account has a
        higher concentration of positive tweets than negative ones.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Most Commonly Used Words</h3>
    <p>
        Here, I generated a WordCloud to visualize the most frequently
        used words in Elon Musk's tweets:
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src="./assets/wordcloud.jpg" alt="Elon Musk word clouds" width="100%" />
    <p>
        The four word clouds above shows Musk's most commonly tweeted words among
        all his tweets, his positive tweets, his neutral tweets, and his negative
        tweets. Common to all the word clouds is "will" being the largest and
        "Tesla" being the second largest. These results make sense as Musk is a
        visionary constantly concerned with the future. Tesla is one of his main
        efforts to make his vision a reality through the production and
        advancement of electric vehicles. Also common to all the word clouds are
        words relating to his companies Tesla and SpaceX, such as "car," "rocket,"
        "model," and "Starship."
    </p>

    <!-- The beginning of the stock market section-->
    <h2>Tweets and the Stock Market</h2>
    <p>
        This section will explore the impact of Elon Musk's tweets on four stocks:
        Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Tesla, and Twitter:
    </p>
    <div class="plotly-container">
        <iframe class="plotly-visualizations" scrolling="no" src="plotly/viz_stocks_tweets.html" height="850"
            width="2160"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>
        The above set of graphs display the normalized stock price and moving
        50-day average for four relevant stocks: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Tesla, and
        Twitter, along with the frequency of Musk's tweets related to each stock.
        The time ranges for each graph are selected based on the relevance of the
        stock and Musk's tweets.
        <br /><br />
        The Bitcoin graph reveals a clear correlation between Musk's Twitter
        activity and Bitcoin's stock trends. From late 2020 to late 2021, Musk's
        tweet frequency related to Bitcoin increased around the same time as
        Bitcoin experienced rapid gains and losses. For instance, on May 12, 2021,
        when Musk announced via Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin
        as payment, the cryptocurrency's value plummeted by nearly 15%.
        <br /><br />
        Similarly, the Dogecoin graph also depicts a correlation between Musk's
        tweets and the cryptocurrency's stock trends. Between January and May
        2021, leading up to Dogecoin's peak in May, Musk tweeted about it with
        high frequency. In fact, Dogecoin surged by 50% after Musk tweeted
        "Dogecoin is the people's crypto" accompanied by a doge-themed image:

            — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)
            <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357236825589432322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2021</a>
        </blockquote>
    </center>
    <p>
        The Tesla graph displays a similar pattern of sporadic tweet frequencies
        and Tesla prices. Although there appears to be no obvious correlation in
        the visualization, examining specific instances lends credence to a
        correlation between Musk's tweets and Tesla's stock price. For instance,
        on May 1, 2020, Musk tweeted "Tesla stock price is too high imo," causing
        Tesla's stock to drop 10% soon after. Additionally, on April Fools Day
        2018, Musk tweeted that "Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt,"
        resulting in Tesla's stock falling by over 8%.
        <br /><br />
        The Twitter graph shows little correlation between his tweets and Twitter
        stock. However, given Musk's recent acquisition of Twitter, more recent
        data may reveal a correlation.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <!-- The beginning of the Google trends section-->
    <h2>Tweets and Google Trends</h2>
    <p>
        This section will explore the impact of Elon Musk's tweets on Google
        Search trends for five search words: "Bitcoin", "Dogecoin", "Elon Musk",
        "Tesla", and "SpaceX":
    </p>
    <div class="plotly-container">
        <iframe class="plotly-visualizations" scrolling="no" src="plotly/viz_trends_tweets.html" height="825"
            width="2160"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>
        The graphs above illustrate the normalized Google Search trends for
        "Bitcoin," "Dogecoin," "Elon Musk," "Tesla," and "SpaceX," along with
        Musk's tweet frequency for each topic. <br /><br />
        The Bitcoin graph exhibits a strong correlation between Musk's tweets and
        Bitcoin's search popularity. Most of Musk's highest tweet frequency days
        align with local maximums in Google searches for Bitcoin. <br /><br />
        Similarly, the Dogecoin graph also shows a correlation between high Google
        search trends and high frequencies of Musk's Dogecoin tweets. Local
        maximums in searches after July 2021 align with a number of Dogecoin
        tweets. <br /><br />
        In contrast to the other four graphs, the Elon Musk graph plots the
        frequency of all his tweets. Interestingly, the highest peak in tweet
        frequency aligns with the highest peak in Google Search trends. However,
        this visualization has a sporadic distribution and makes it difficult to
        discern a clear correlation. <br /><br />
        The Tesla graph demonstrates a slight correlation between Musk's
        Tesla-related tweet frequency and Tesla search trends. As Musk's tweet
        frequency increased over time, search trends generally increased as well.
        Leaps in search trends coincided with leaps in tweet frequency during
        March 2018, April 2019, Feb 2020, Jul 2020, Nov 2021, and April 2022.
        <br /><br />
        Finally, the SpaceX graph indicates no correlation between search trends
        and Musk's SpaceX-related tweet frequency. Despite a massive number of
        tweets from April 2018 to April 2020, SpaceX search trends saw no
        significant change.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Elon Musk is undoubtedly a one-of-a-kind individual. His Twitter account
        is known for its humor, visionary ideas, and the ability to impact
        financial markets with his tweets. With his recent acquisition of Twitter,
        it's clear that Musk is taking things to a whole new level. As a highly
        influential and powerful figure, we can only anticipate what he has in
        store for the future.
